# Javascript Array Methods
As of my knowledge cutoff in 2021, these are all the methods that are available on the Array prototype in JavaScript.
However, it's worth noting that new features and methods may be added to JavaScript in the future, and some methods may be deprecated or removed.
Additionally, some JavaScript environments or frameworks may provide their own additional methods for working with arrays.
So while these are all the standard methods available on the Array prototype in JavaScript, there may be other methods available in certain contexts.
